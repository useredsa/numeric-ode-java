Types of Methods (non-exclusive)

. Fixed Step Method
Uses always the same step size, does not keep state.

. Adaptive Step Method
Has a way to estimate the error and to adjust the step depending on that.
Needs a tolerance to adjust the step.
Keeps the current step size as state.

. Multi Step Method
Uses the information from many previous steps.
Needs the state of the previous steps.

. Implicit Method

. Explicit Method

. Predictor Corrector
Uses the value of an explicit method for an implicit method.
Depending on the methods mixed, a lot of calculations may be reused.

.. PECE (Predict-Evaluate-Correct-Evaluate) mode
Predicts with an explicit method,
evaluates the derivative at that point,
corrects with an implicit method and
evaluates again the derivative using the corrected point.

.. PEC (Predict-Evaluate-Correct) mode
Predicts with an explicit method,
evaluates the derivative at that point and
corrects with an implicit method,
using for future steps the derivative without correction.

Optimizations

. Optimizations that can make code more difficult to reuse

.. Some values of the method can be already precalculated.
Calling the method again makes our code slower.

.. Usually, the derivative at the current point can be known.
